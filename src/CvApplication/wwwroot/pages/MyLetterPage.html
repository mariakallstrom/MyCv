                Hi! <br/> <br/>
                Are you the company I am looking for to do my LIA practice? <br/>
                I am a happy and driven girl who would like to develop more. I really like to solve problems and I like to work with improvements.
                <br/> I like to be creative and have no difficulty learning new things. I think it's fun with challenges.
                <br/>I am organized and accurate and I have no problem to think outside the box if necessary. I like working in groups, often with people who are as committed as me, but have no difficulty do assignments on my own.
                <br/>
                <br/>I applied to Nackademin professional education because I feel that it's programming and technology that is closest to me heart. I had worked in the same company for a while and I needed a big change.
                <br/>The first weeks of training has been both fun and a little stressful because the level and the pace has been high but I understand that that is how it will work like in a workplace and it will not stop me.
                I look forward to getting out and practicing and I think I will learn a lot, hopefully, much more than sitting on the lessons.
                <br/><br/>To add is that I am the person that my former colleagues called for "hacker" because I usually solved their IT problems before they needed to contact IT support. Basically I have always been interested in technology. I also liked to improve my or my colleagues' worksituations by coming up with IT solutions. For example. I found and downloaded good add-ins and VBA scripts or I created useful macros in Excel.
                <br/> <br/>In addition, I also have good knowledge in Microsoft Office. If you want to know more and get to know me better, do not hesitate to contact me. I hope you have the LIA place I need to develop myself in the best way.
                <br/>
                <br/>Sincerely Maria
