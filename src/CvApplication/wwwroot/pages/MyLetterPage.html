        Hi! <br/> <br/>
        I am a happy and driven girl who would like to develop more. I really like to solve problems and I like to work with improvements.
        I like to be creative and have no difficulty learning new things.
        <br/> <br/>
        I think it's fun with challenges.
        I am organized and accurate and I have no problem to think outside the box if necessary. I like working in groups, often with people who are as committed as me, but have no difficulty do assignments on my own.
        <br/> <br/>
        I applied to Nackademin professional education because I feel that it's programming and technology that is closest to me heart. I had worked in the same company for a while and I needed a big change.
        <br /><br /> first weeks of training has been both fun and a little stressful because the level and the pace has been high but I understand that that is how it will work like in a workplace and it will not stop me.
        <br /><br />I look forward to getting out and practicing and I think I will learn a lot, hopefully, much more than sitting on the lessons.

        To add is that I am the person that my former colleagues called for "hacker" because I usually solved their IT problems before they needed to contact IT support.
        <br/> <br/> Basically I have always been interested in technology. I also liked to improve my or my colleagues' worksituations by coming up with IT solutions. For example. I found and downloaded good add-ins and VBA scripts or I created useful macros in Excel.
        In addition, I also have good knowledge in Microsoft Office.
        <br/> <br/> If you want to know more and get to know me better, do not hesitate to contact me. I hope you have the LIA place I need to develop myself in the best way.
        <br/> <br/>
        Sincerely Maria
